# Google Sheets with React

This app uses google oauth2 and the google sheets api to take data entered into a form and append it to a google sheets document. This provides a simple and free way of storing data when hosting a full database server is not necessary.

### Possible Caveats

Has not been tested with other google accounts yet. Hopefully the owner of the google sheets document can decide who has access to a document, and the oauth2 api will automatically take care of allowing or denying access to document.
